/**
 * Express the type of a instantiatable class that extends an abstract
 *
 * Usage: Treat this as a function, passing an abstract class name as T.
 *
 * - Whenever `RegularClass` is not an abstract class,
 * - then `RegularClass: typeof SomeAbstract; new RegularClass()` won't work,
 * - but `RegularClass: Concrete<SomeAbstract>; new RegularClass()` WILL work.
 *
 * Why? Occasionally you need to represent a collection of that constructed instances that inherit
 * from an abstract class. This happens frequently when using the pattern of metadata-decorating
 * classes that extend an abstract with metadata interaction â€” like TaskService and
 * EndpointControllers in this project. Since abstracts can't be constructed, using
 * `typeof SomeAbstract[]` won't allow you to call `new` on any of the new-able instances.
 * Frustrating. This is a workaround from Angular, which exports it as `Type`. Here it's renamed
 * for our use case.
